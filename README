# Symfony Doctrine Settings Plugin #

This plugin allows the easy use of a basic dynamic settings table. Much like the
{{{ sfConfig::get() }}} method, use {{{ csSettings::get() }}} to call dynamic settings.  An admin 
generator interface (csSettings module) allows easy setting administration.

All settings are cached when first loaded, and the cache is refreshed whenever a
setting is changed or added.  

After the settings have been loaded, they are cached for retrieval by
{{{ csSettings::get() }}} (returns a string value) or {{{ csSettings::getSetting() }}} (returns
an csSetting object)

## Backend ##
An admin module also exists for managing the settings in the database. you must enable the module in order to access it

    [yaml]
    # /apps/myapp/config/settings.yml
    all:
      .settings:
         enabled_modules:        [default, csSettings]

This module can be used to edit the variables as the plugin was originally built with the value for the setting being on the 
list page and editable from there, or it can behave like a normal admin-generated page.
By default, you must be authenticated to edit the setting configurations themselves.  
If you want to prevent validated users from editing the setting configurations, you can
override the authMethod setting in your app.yml:

    [yaml]
    # /config/app.yml
    all:
      csSettingsPlugin:
         authMethod:        isSuperAdmin  # or whatever method you want called on myUser.
